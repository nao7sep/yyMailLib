            // - This is the most common form used, especially in the fields of computer science and cryptography.
            // - It refers to unencrypted text or data that is readable without any decryption.
            // - Typically used in contexts involving data encryption, security, and information processing.

            // "Plain-text" (Hyphenated):
            // - This form is less common but still correct.
            // - Sometimes used in writing and publishing to emphasize the contrast with formatted or rich text.
            // - It can be seen in discussions about text formatting, where distinguishing between different types of text is important.

            // Note:
            // - The choice between "plaintext" and "plain-text" often depends on stylistic preference or the conventions of the specific field.
            // - In technical and computer-related fields, "plaintext" as one word is generally the preferred usage.
